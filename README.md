# AAFD Gender and Age Classifier
This repository contains a project focused on classifying gender and age using the Asian Faces Dataset (AFD). The implementation utilizes Keras to build and train neural network models for this purpose.

## Project Structure
- Data: Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- Notebooks: Includes Jupyter notebooks detailing data preprocessing, model training, and result visualization.
- Colab: Contains Google Colab notebooks used for model training and result visualization.
- Models: Stores the trained models.
- Plots: Contains graphs and metrics from the training processes.

## Getting Started
To get a comprehensive understanding of the project, start by exploring the notebooks in the Notebooks directory. These notebooks provide step-by-step explanations of data cleaning, model training, and evaluation processes.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

### Usage
- Data Preprocessing: Use the notebooks in the Notebooks directory to clean and preprocess the AFD dataset.
- Model Training: Train the neural network models using the provided notebooks or the Google Colab versions in the Colab directory.
- Evaluation: Evaluate the models and visualize the results using the plots and metrics available in the Plots directory.


## Results
The project provides visualizations of training metrics, including accuracy and loss curves, to assess the performance of the gender and age classification models.
